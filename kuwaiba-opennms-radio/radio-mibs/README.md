# Radio Network MIBs

This folder contains separate folders for each radio device modelled in the simulation.

In each device folder, the `unchanged` folder contains the raw mibs and OpenNMS generated configuration files.
The `customised` folder contains the configuration used for OpenNMS and this should be replicated in the docker compose project itself.

Note that not all of the devices have been fully modelled in this example.
